# GSoC 2017 Joomla PR Testing Platform

## What is this?
---------------------
* This is a platform meant for allowing users to test PRs more easily without much effort or knowledge to setup the Joomla instance for the PR to be tested
* The idea would be to have a website with github authentication where the user can request his desired environment to test the PR. 
* The user will be presented with options to configure the test environment for the intended test request with PHP versions. After requesting the test the user is redirected to the working Joomla! instance ready for testing right away.

## Installing
